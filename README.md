# Combat Arena

#### Purpose
The purpose of this code was to learn Ruby. It's an extremely basic text based RPG-style combat simulator. As a lifelong gamer, I tend to lean towards gaming projects of some sort when I'm learning a new programming language.

#### Future Plans (Maybe)
Future additions may include (depending on how long I work on this):
* Some sort of healing or rest system to recover HP
* Saving and loading characters
* A shop option to upgrade equipment
* Leveling system so the player isn't eternally a level 1 noob
